				Airbending,
			</h1>
			<p>
				one of the four elemental bending 
				arts, is the aerokinetic ability to control and 
				manipulate air. The peaceful Air Nomads utilized
				this type of bending in their everyday lives.

				Air Nomads is the collective term for the 
				monastic order of men and women who practice 
				the discipline of airbending and their 
				seclusive, theocratic society. One of the 
				four major nations, the Air Nomads were 
				wanderers by definition, but had four air 
				temples, one at each corner of the globe, 
				hidden away atop mountain ranges and under 
				cliffs, in the northern Earth Kingdom and on 
				three remote islands. Unlike the other nations, 
				the people of the Air Nomads were, without any 
				seen exception, all benders due to the high 
				level of spirituality of their people.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Air Nomads were a peaceful race who were wiped 
				out by the Fire Nation. They lived in large temples 
				and traveled the world on flying bison. They were the 
				most spiritual of all the cultures and lived in harmony 
				with nature. They also were fun-loving and had a 
				strong sense of humor.
