				Firebending, 
			</h1>
			<p>
				one of the four elemental bending arts, is 
				the pyrokinetic ability to control fire. It 
				is unique among the bending arts, as it is 
				the only one in which the performer can 
				generate the element. The first human 
				firebenders lived in a city atop a lion 
				turtle during the era of Raava and the art 
				later spread to the Sun Warriors, the 
				Fire Nation, and the United Republic of 
				Nations. The Earth Kingdom also has a 
				small firebending minority.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Fire Nation is one of the world's four 
				nations and five sovereign states. It is an 
				absolute monarchy led by the Fire Lord and 
				home to most firebenders. Geographically, 
				the nation is located along the planet's 
				equator in the western hemisphere and is 
				composed of several islands. Its capital 
				is simply known as the Fire Nation Capital.

				The Fire Nation is the second-largest nation 
				in terms of area, following the Earth Kingdom, 
				while its economy is the most powerful in the 
				world; its strong industrial sector and extensive 
				technological developments not only enabled the 
				Fire Nation to create an extremely powerful military, 
				but also initiated the worldwide modernization and 
				globalization. Before the foundation of the United 
				Republic and the following global technological 
				revolution, it was also the strongest and most 
				advanced country in the world.
