				Suki 
			</h1>
			<p>
				Suki was the eldest member and leader of the all-female Kyoshi 
				Warriors of the Earth Kingdom's Kyoshi Island. Having begun 
				her training when she was only eight years old, she was well-respected 
				by her fellow warriors for her leadership and combat skills. 
				When Team Avatar arrived on Kyoshi Island, Suki and a few 
				other Kyoshi Warriors captured them, thinking they were Fire 
				Nation spies, but released them and befriended them after

				realizing Aang was the Avatar. Inspired by the outsiders 
				for helping save their village from Prince Zuko, she and the 
				other Kyoshi Warriors left the island to help the Earth 
				Kingdom fight against the Fire Nation. During their journey, 
				she protected the Avatar's lost sky bison, Appa, from falling 
				into the enemy's hands, but she and the other Kyoshi Warriors 
				were defeated by Princess Azula, Mai, and Ty Lee.
			</p>
			<p>
				Imprisoned in the Fire Nation, Suki was placed within a 
				high-security prison. It was only by good fortune that Sokka 
				and Zuko infiltrated the facility looking for Sokka's 
				captured father, Hakoda, instead finding her. Freed from 
				captivity, Suki later helped Aang and friends defeat the 
				Fire Nation and eventually reunited with her fellow Kyoshi 
				Warriors.
