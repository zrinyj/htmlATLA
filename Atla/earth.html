				Earthbending, 
			</h1>
			<p>
				one of the four elemental bending arts, is 
				the geokinetic ability to manipulate earth 
				and rock in all their various forms, 
				prevalent in the Earth Kingdom and the 
				United Republic.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Earth Kingdom is one of the world's four nations. 
				Spanning an entire continent as well as several 
				subsidiary islands, it is the largest and most 
				populated sovereignty in the world and encompasses 
				much of the eastern hemisphere. The kingdom is ruled 
				by a monarchy which operates under the rule of a 
				king or queen. The last earth monarch was the 54th 
				Earth King, Wu, of the Hou-Ting Dynasty, who desired 
				to abdicate the throne in 174 AG in favor of splitting 
				the nation into independent states with democratically 
				elected leaders, akin to the political system used in 
				the United Republic of Nations.

				The Earth Kingdom is characterized by significant ethnic 
				and cultural diversity, a consequence of the country's 
				vast territorial expanse. As a result, it suffers from high levels 
				of local autonomy and ethnic conflict, both 
				of which began accelerating as the central government 
				grew weak. Despite this division, the people's recognition 
				of the Earth Kingdom as a single political entity is 
				largely strengthened through the communal belief in a 
				shared history and identity.
