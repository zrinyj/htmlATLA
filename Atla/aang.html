				Aang the Last Airbender

				Aang was a male Air Nomad born in 12 BG and 
				the Avatar during the century-long conflict 
				known as the Hundred Year War. His 
				immediate predecessor was Avatar Roku, and 
				his immediate successor is Avatar Korra. As 
				the Avatar of his time, he was the only 
				person capable of using all four bending 
				arts: airbending, waterbending, earthbending, 
				and firebending. He was also one of a select 
				few Avatars, and one of the first in many 
				cycles to learn the ancient art of energybending, 
				and the first Avatar known to have actively used 
				the technique.

				Shortly before the beginning of the Hundred 
				Year War, Aang was frozen in an iceberg for 
				a hundred years; he later emerged, still 
				biologically twelve years old, into a world 
				engulfed by war. During his absence, the 
				Fire Nation had waged war upon the other 
				nations and managed to completely wipe out 
				the pacifistic Air Nomads. It fell to Aang, 
				the last airbender and the Avatar, to end 
				the War by mastering the other three elements 
				and defeating Fire Lord Ozai. He remained a 
				kind and goofy kid at heart throughout his 
				year-long struggle, despite the overwhelming 
				loss of his people and the heavy burdens he 
				was forced to bear. After his victory over the 
				Phoenix King, Aang began a romantic relationship 
				with his close friend, Katara. The couple eventually 
				married and raised a family of three children: Bumi, 
				a nonbender who became an airbender later in life, 
				Kya, a waterbender, and the youngest, Tenzin, an 
				airbender.
			</p>
			<p>
				Aang was always able to excel at any new bending 
				moves he learned; at the age of six, he was a better 
				airbender than children twice his age, and by the age 
				of ten, Aang had proven himself to be better than his 
				own teachers. He earned airbending tattoos and 
				the status of an airbending master by the age of 
				twelve for exhibiting prodigious talent with his 
				native element and with his invention of the air 
				scooter, making him the youngest airbending 
				master in Air Nomad history.
