				Katara
			</h1>
			<p>
				Katara is a waterbending master, born in the 
				Southern Water Tribe to Chief Hakoda and his wife, 
				Kya. During her childhood, she was the only waterbender 
				living in the South Pole. At first she lived a peaceful 
				life with her family, until she lost her mother in a Fire 
				Nation raid. After her father left to battle against the 
				Fire Nation in the Hundred Year War, Katara was raised by 
				<img src="katara.jpg" alt="Katara" style="float:left">
				her paternal grandmother, Kanna, alongside her older 
				brother, Sokka. As a teenager, she and her brother discovered 
				the young Air Nomad Avatar, Aang, who had been frozen in an 
				iceberg with his bison, Appa, for one hundred years. In need of 
				a waterbending master, the siblings and Aang left the 
				South Pole on a journey toward the Northern 
				Water Tribe. Katara and Sokka eventually became 
				close friends with Aang, and after their journey 
				to the North Pole, continued to travel with him 
				across the world as he mastered the remaining 
				elements, earth and fire. The siblings' assistance 
				helped Aang halt the Fire Nation's ambitions of 
				world domination, ending the century-long war, and 
				finally restoring balance to the world.
