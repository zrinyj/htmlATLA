				Waterbending, 
			</h1>
			<p>
				one of the four elemental bending arts, is 
				the hydrokinetic ability to control water 
				in all of its various forms. This type of 
				bending is used by the people of the Water 
				Tribe, who are divided into the Southern, 
				Northern, and lesser known Foggy Swamp 
				tribes, as well as those of the United 
				Republic, each with their own unique 
				bending style.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Water Tribe is a collective term for the 
				nation of people who practice the art of 
				waterbending. It is one of the original four 
				nations and its citizens primarily inhabit the 
				northern and southernmost regions of the globe, 
				near both poles. Many people of Water Tribe 
				ethnicity also live in the United Republic and 
				there is a small community of waterbenders that 
				populate the Foggy Swamp in

				the Earth Kingdom, although they were isolated from 
				their sister tribes for generations and others were 
				largely unaware of their existence until they were 
				stumbled upon by Avatar Aang, Katara, and Sokka.
			</p>
			<p>
				The people of the Water Tribe are generally 
				peaceful, and strive to live in harmony 
				with nature and the other nations of the 
				world. There are two primary divisions of 
				the Water Tribe, the Northern Tribe and the 
				Southern Tribe.
