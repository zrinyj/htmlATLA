				Zuko is a firebending master, born as a prince in the Fire 
				Nation Royal Family, who held the title of Fire Lord from 100 
				AG to 167 AG. Originally the primary enemy of Team Avatar, 
				Zuko devoted three years to trying to capture the long-lost 
				Avatar to end his banishment and regain his honor as Crown 
				Prince of the Fire Nation. He is recognizable by the distinctive 
				scar on the left side of his face, which was given to him by 
				his father, Fire Lord Ozai, shortly before his banishment as 
				a result of an incident in which he unintentionally disrespected 
				his father by speaking out of turn and refusing to duel him.
			</p>
			<p>
				With support from his paternal uncle, General Iroh, and after 
				much internal struggle and turmoil, Zuko rejected Ozai and his 
				model of the Fire Nation. He instead joined the Avatar's group 
				to become Aang's lifelong friend and firebending mentor and 
				was determined to end the war and restore both his and the Fire 
				Nation's honor. While Aang defeated Ozai, Zuko, with the 
				help of Katara, defeated his younger sister Princess Azula and 
				took his place as Fire Lord, declaring the end of the Hundred 
				Year War and the start of an era of love and peace.

				At the beginning of his reign, Zuko had to overcome great 
				difficulties and solve several crises, especially those caused 
				by the Harmony Restoration Movement and the New Ozai Society.
				Nevertheless, he succeeded in maintaining peace and eventually 
				became one of the founders of the United Republic of Nations. 
				Zuko stepped down from his position as Fire Lord in 167 AG and 
				became an ambassador of peace, relinquishing the throne to his 
				daughter, Izumi.
