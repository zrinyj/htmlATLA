				Sokka 
			</h1>
			<p>
				Sokka was a Water Tribe warrior of the Southern Water Tribe and 
				the son of Chief Hakoda and Kya. Following the death of his mother 
				and his father's leave for war, Sokka was raised by his grandmother 
				Kanna along with his younger sister Katara.
			</p>
			<p>
				Hakoda left along with all of the other men in his tribe to 
				fight the Fire Nation when Sokka was a young boy. Despite 
				his desire to join his father, Sokka was not permitted to 
				accompany the men on the mission and was left behind. As 
				there were no other teenage boys in the tribe, Sokka was the 
				oldest male in the South Pole and, therefore, left as the 
				leader of the tribe. He assumed responsibility for the tribe, 
				haplessly training children to be future warriors, until his 
				sister discovered an Air Nomad named Aang frozen in an iceberg. 
				When he learned that Aang was the Avatar, he was at first 
				skeptical that a child could really save the world. As he and 
				his sister helped Aang on his quest, he began to believe that 
				Aang really was the only hope for peace in the world.

				Despite his inability to bend, Sokka became the strategist 
				of the group, constantly trying to prove himself to be a 
				great warrior like his father. He attempted to train the 
				younger children of the Southern Water Tribe in fighting. 
				Sokka was also the "matter of fact" guy in the group and did 
				not believe in spirit magic, as he openly mocked it.
				His leadership skills improved during his travels with the 
				Avatar, culminating with his masterminding the plan for the 
				invasion of the Fire Nation on the Day of Black Sun. His
				humor and his ability to organize and plan became imperative 
				to the group on their travels. By the conclusion of the 
				Hundred Year War, Sokka became a master swordsman and a 
				great warrior like his father.
