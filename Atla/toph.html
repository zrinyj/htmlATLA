				Toph 
			</h1>
			<p>
				Toph Beifong is an earthbending master, one of the most powerful 
				of her time, and the discoverer of metalbending. Blind since birth, 
				Toph was constantly treated condescendingly because of her visual 
				impairment, particularly by her overprotective parents, Lao and 
				Poppy Beifong. Upon discovering badgermoles, earthbending animals 
				who are also blind, she learned how to use earthbending as an 
				extension of her senses. This gave her the ability to "see" every
				vibration that passes through the ground.

				Having developed her own unique style of earthbending, Toph 
				acquired a toughened personality and became famous for winning 
				underground earthbending tournaments under the name "The Blind 
				Bandit", doing so behind her parents' backs. Although 
				initially uninterested in directly aiding the war effort, she 
				eventually chose to leave behind her old life, and travel with 
				Avatar Aang and his friends as his earthbending teacher, when her 
				parents finally became unbearable for her. Toph's total 
				mastery over earthbending, unique personality, and thoughtful 
				pragmatism made her a valuable addition to the team.
			</p>
			<p>
				After Republic City's formation, Toph became the city's 
				first Chief of Police, forming the Metalbending Police Force 
				to help maintain order. She had two daughters with two 
				different men: Lin, who succeeded her as Chief of Police, 
				and Suyin, who created the metal city of Zaofu. Toph eventually 
				set out to roam the world in search of enlightenment before 
				settling down in the Foggy Swamp.
